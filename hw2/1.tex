\section*{Problem 1}

\noindent
The advantage of random variable selection strategy in random forests is that
we reduce the possibility of generating highly correlated bagged trees. Highly
correlated trees lead to low prediction accuracy. The random variable selection 
strategy works best if the there are very few interaction among the features. Another
advantage of the method is increase in the computation speed gained due to
less feature exploration. 

On clear disadvantage of random variable selection strategy is not being able to 
capture the interaction effects among the features. Besides, we do not have the
liberty to split on the best feature due to the constraint on variable selection. This 
leads to increase in the bias of the trees generated on average and may lead to
decrease in prediction accuracy when many trees with low predictive power are 
averaged.

An alternate startegy to random variable selection in the random forests is to 
randomly change the size of bootstrap sample and allow all variables to be split at 
each node. This strategy introduces variation in the trees due to sampling and 
ensures capturing interaction effects.
